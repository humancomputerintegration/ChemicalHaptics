# Processing TCATA Data

Each folder corresponds to a participant in our study.

Each file in the folder corresponds to a particular trial/chemical.

Use the file [Trial Chemical Key]() to determine which chemical the trial corresponds to.



Each file has the table format of:

Time	Attribute	State	Phase

In the Time Column the Microsecond Time Stamp

In the Attribute Column - the Attribute descriptor chosen (burning, warm, cooling, etc.)

State - Checked-1/Unchecked-0 or in other words if the participant noted the presence or absence of the attribute sensation

Phase - Which section of the trial this was during (ON_TCATA - chemical being applied, OFF_TCATA - chemical removed)



At the end of each file is an entry of which was the dominant sensation chosen for the trial.
